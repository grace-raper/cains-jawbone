# Passage
>Next day I let Caroline Jasmine---what a name!---do her very damnedest for my guest. But I was doubtful of her influence all the while. What a man! Henry, I supposed, was about his business and concern, such as it was. What is removed drops horribly in a pail. Why should that stick in my head?

I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it. That should be, I thought, a consolation for my patient. Surely such a confirmed old tub-thumper would not have had the wit to think out the Mithradates inoculation for himself, and put it into practice? Perish the thought, and the fellow.
