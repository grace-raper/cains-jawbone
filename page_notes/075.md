# Passage
>I saw to it that I should be for a moment alone among the marigolds. Thinking kindly of those two other flowers, which I felt almost certain now would win me the girl I felt I could love, I exulted. Dear old Gerard, he said it was called Calendula as it is to be seene to flower in the calends of almost everie month. I turned the strong searchlights of my eyes upon the orange tinted documents. But I could not read them. My eyes, or something, were not good enough. And yet I was not among those who attempt, ek parergou, to confound ephphatha with epea pteroenta. You would have noticed my oriental preference when I smoke, and would not have been surprised that my Indian tobacco, after a scant four-and-twenty hours, was doing excellent work. It seemed almost certain that the blight would be destroyed : the blight on the May, or on the delight that is as wide-eyed as a marigold.
